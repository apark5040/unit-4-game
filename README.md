# Crystal Clicking Game

This is a simple game where you must click certain crystals to get the counter up to the same number as the given random value.

The game will give you a random number. The crystals will also be given a random value when clicked. 

You must click the crystals to equal the random number given by the game. 

If the number goes over, you lose.
